        <p>The mission of this website is to help consumers gain accurate data to exchange between their doctors/healthcare providers. When a consumer has one doctor in one health system, and a specialist in another system, prescription data can be misrepresented. This is damaging to the consumer, medical doctor/staff, and provider. To fix this, RxSync was created to help consumers maintain accurate prescription data.</p>
